% The objective was to predict pasture production from a variety of biophysical
% factors. Vegetation and soil variables from areas of grazed North Island 
% hill country with different management (fertilizer application/stocking rate)
% histories (1973-1994) were measured and subdivided into 36 paddocks. Ninteen 
% vegetation (including herbage producution); soil chemical, physical and 
% biological; and soil water variables were selected as potentially useful 
% biophysical indicators.
