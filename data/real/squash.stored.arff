% The purpose of the research was to determine the changes taking place in
% squash fruit during the maturation and ripening so as to pinpoint the best
% time to give the best quality at the market place (Japan). The squash is
% transported to Japan by refrigerated cargo vessels and takes three to four
% weeks to reach the market. Evaluations were carried out at a stage 
% representing the quality inspection stage prior to export and also at the 
% stage it would reach on arriving at the market place. 
%
% The original objectives were to determine which pre-harvest variables
% contribute to good tasting squash after different periods of storage time. 
% This is determined by whether a measure of acceptability found by 
% categorising each squash as either unacceptable, acceptable or excellent.
%
% The fruit in this dataset were stored before being measured, and they have
% an extra attribute that squash-unstored lacks - the weight of the fruit after
% storage.
